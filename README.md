PCA transforms a set of correlated variables to a new set of uncorrected variables. If the original variables are already near uncorrelated then nothing could be gained by PCA.


4.MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES
In this project, we focused on constructing robust and reliable ML models for the IBM dataset classication. A total of five ML models are investigated: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest(RF) Support Vector Machines (SVM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The details and performances of the model will be discussed as follows.

For each models, we trained our model in three separate phases
